# zDash CLI

**zDash** is a developer-first CLI tool designed to become your command-line dashboard for *agentic AI-assisted development*. While the current version is a minimal "Hello World" scaffold, it's the foundation for a powerful devtool that will help you track, analyze, and optimize how you use AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others.
